## Fork Notes
* Support original parameterisation as in [Quad lights(Original)](https://blog.selfshadow.com/sandbox/ltc.html) for comparison.
* Support clip light rect against axis-aligned plane.

## Overview
This repository contains an (evolving) reference implementation for the following publications:
* [Real-Time Polygonal-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/415-2/) (2016)
* [Real-Time Area Lighting: a Journey From Research to Production](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2016-advances/) (2016)
* [Linear-Light Shading with Linearly Transformed Cosines](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/04/17/linear-light-shading-with-linearly-transformed-cosines/) (2017)
* [Real-Time Line- and Disk-Light Shading](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2017-shading-course/) (2017)

## Notes:
* The Linearly Transformed Cosine (LTC) tables in this implementation differ in their parameterisation and storage compared to [the original paper](https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/415-2/). See fitting code and WebGL demos for details.
